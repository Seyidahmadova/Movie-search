## [Live Demo](https://main--incomparable-duckanoo-d3ae00.netlify.app/)


In my project, i requested insecure resource (http). So  when i deploy project to netlify it doesn't allow to search ( we can't fetch). If you are interested in my project you can pull project. 

I share my screen to show that in local fetch is working
